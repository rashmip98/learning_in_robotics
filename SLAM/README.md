## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a particle filter
Implemented mapping and localization in an indoor environment using information from an IMU and a LiDAR sensor. The data used was collected from a humanoid named [THOR](https://archive.darpa.mil/roboticschallenge/finalist/thor.html) that was built at Penn and UCLA. You can read more about the hardware in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7057369.)

The results of the SLAM algorithm can be seen in the [results](https://github.com/rashmip98/learning_in_robotics/tree/main/SLAM/results) folder for 4 different maps and data
